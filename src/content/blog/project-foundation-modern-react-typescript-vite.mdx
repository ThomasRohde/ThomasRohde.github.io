# Project Foundation: Setting Up Modern React with TypeScript and Vite

Welcome to the implementation phase of our spec-driven development journey! After establishing our requirements, design, and task planning in previous posts, it's time to get our hands dirty with actual code. Today, we're diving deep into **Task 1: Project Foundation Setup**—the critical first step that sets the stage for everything that follows.

This isn't just another "create-react-app" tutorial. This is a detailed exploration of how spec-driven development guides even the most fundamental setup decisions, ensuring our foundation aligns perfectly with our project requirements.

## Task Objective: Building the Right Foundation

From our task specification, the objective is clear: **Initialize a modern React project with TypeScript and Vite that supports our personal landing page and blog requirements.**

But what does "modern" mean in this context? Let's trace this back to our requirements:

- **Requirement 1.1**: Professional landing page with responsive design
- **Requirement 1.2**: Modern development tooling and build system
- **Requirement 1.3**: TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Requirement 1.4**: Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- **Requirement 1.5**: Blog system with MDX support for rich content

These requirements immediately inform our technology choices. We need:

- React 19 for the latest features and performance improvements
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- MDX support for our blog system
- A foundation that supports modern CSS frameworks and component libraries

## Implementation Approach: Strategic Technology Selection

### Why Vite Over Create React App?

The choice between Vite and Create React App isn't arbitrary—it's driven by our requirements:

**Build Performance (Requirement 1.2)**: Vite's ES modules-based development server provides instant hot module replacement, crucial for productive development.

**Modern Tooling (Requirement 1.2)**: Vite embraces modern JavaScript features and provides better TypeScript integration out of the box.

**Extensibility (Requirement 1.5)**: Vite's plugin ecosystem makes MDX integration straightforward, essential for our blog system.

### TypeScript Configuration Strategy

Our TypeScript setup needs to balance strictness with productivity:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

**Key decisions explained**:

- **Strict mode enabled**: Catches potential issues early, supporting our quality requirements
- **Path aliases (`@/*`)**: Clean imports that improve code organization
- **Modern target (ES2020)**: Leverages latest JavaScript features while maintaining broad compatibility

## Step-by-Step Foundation Setup

### Step 1: Project Initialization

```bash
# Create the project with Vite's React-TypeScript template
npm create vite@latest personal-landing-page -- --template react-ts

# Navigate to the project directory
cd personal-landing-page

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

This gives us a solid starting point, but we need to customize it for our specific requirements.

### Step 2: Essential Dependencies Installation

Our requirements analysis reveals several key dependencies:

```bash
# Core routing and navigation (Requirement 4.1, 4.2)
npm install react-router-dom

# UI framework and styling (Requirement 2.4, 4.3)
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# MDX support for blog system (Requirement 3.1, 3.2)
npm install @mdx-js/rollup @mdx-js/react
npm install remark-gfm rehype-pretty-code

# Component library foundation (Requirement 4.3)
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge

# Development tools (Requirement 7.2, 7.3)
npm install -D @types/node
npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
npm install -D prettier
```

**Dependency rationale**:

- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing for our multi-page application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **MDX ecosystem**: Enables rich blog content with React components
- **Radix UI utilities**: Foundation for accessible, customizable components
- **Development tools**: Linting, formatting, and type checking

### Step 3: Vite Configuration for MDX

The most complex part of our setup is configuring Vite to handle MDX files. This directly supports Requirement 3.1 (blog system with rich content):

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';
import rehypePrettyCode from 'rehype-pretty-code';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    mdx({
      remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
      rehypePlugins: [
        [
          rehypePrettyCode,
          {
            theme: 'github-dark',
            keepBackground: false,
          },
        ],
      ],
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

**Configuration highlights**:

- **MDX plugin integration**: Processes `.mdx` files as React components
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Supports tables, task lists, and other GitHub features
- **Syntax highlighting**: Pretty code blocks with GitHub Dark theme
- **Path aliases**: Clean imports using `@/` prefix

### Step 4: Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind CSS setup supports our responsive design requirements (1.1, 2.4):

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            maxWidth: 'none',
            color: 'inherit',
            a: {
              color: 'inherit',
              textDecoration: 'underline',
              fontWeight: '500',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
};
```

**Key features**:

- **Content scanning**: Includes MDX files for proper class detection
- **Typography plugin**: Enhanced styling for blog content
- **Customized prose**: Inherits theme colors for consistent design

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: MDX TypeScript Integration

**Problem**: TypeScript doesn't recognize `.mdx` files by default, causing import errors.

**Solution**: Create a type declaration file:

```typescript
// src/vite-env.d.ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

declare module '*.mdx' {
  let MDXComponent: (props: any) => JSX.Element;
  export default MDXComponent;
}
```

This tells TypeScript how to handle MDX imports, enabling type checking while maintaining flexibility.

### Challenge 2: Path Alias Configuration

**Problem**: TypeScript and Vite need consistent path resolution for the `@/` alias.

**Solution**: Synchronize configurations:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts - Vite resolution
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
  },
}

// tsconfig.json - TypeScript resolution
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
```

Both tools now understand the same path mapping, preventing import issues.

### Challenge 3: ESLint Configuration for Modern Setup

**Problem**: Default ESLint rules don't account for modern React patterns and TypeScript.

**Solution**: Comprehensive ESLint configuration:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
import js from '@eslint/js';
import globals from 'globals';
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';
import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh';
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ['dist'] },
  {
    extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks,
      'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
        'warn',
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  }
);
```

This configuration supports modern React patterns while maintaining code quality.

## Verification Against Requirements

Let's verify our foundation setup against the specific requirements:

### Requirement 1.1 (Professional Landing Page)

✅ **Fulfilled**: React + TypeScript provides robust component architecture for professional UI

### Requirement 1.2 (Modern Development Tooling)

✅ **Fulfilled**: Vite offers fast development server, optimized builds, and modern JavaScript support

### Requirement 1.3 (Type Safety)

✅ **Fulfilled**: TypeScript strict mode enabled with comprehensive configuration

### Requirement 1.4 (Component Architecture)

✅ **Fulfilled**: React 19 with modern patterns, path aliases for clean organization

### Requirement 1.5 (Blog System Foundation)

✅ **Fulfilled**: MDX integration configured with syntax highlighting and GitHub Flavored Markdown

## Development Workflow Verification

Let's test our setup with a quick development workflow:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production to verify configuration
npm run build
```

**Expected results**:

- Development server starts on `http://localhost:5173`
- Hot module replacement works instantly
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- Build produces optimized output in `dist/` directory

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot resolve @/ imports"

**Symptoms**: TypeScript errors on imports using `@/` prefix

**Solution**: Verify both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` have matching path configurations

### Issue: "MDX files not recognized"

**Symptoms**: Import errors when importing `.mdx` files

**Solution**: Ensure `vite-env.d.ts` includes MDX module declaration

### Issue: "Tailwind classes not applying"

**Symptoms**: Tailwind utility classes have no effect

**Solution**: Check `tailwind.config.js` content array includes all relevant file extensions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Requirements Drive Technology Choices**: Every dependency and configuration decision traces back to specific project requirements

2. **Foundation Quality Matters**: Time invested in proper setup pays dividends throughout development

3. **Modern Tooling Enables Productivity**: Vite + TypeScript + MDX creates a powerful development environment

4. **Configuration Consistency is Critical**: Ensure all tools (TypeScript, Vite, ESLint) work together harmoniously

5. **Verification is Essential**: Test the complete development workflow before proceeding to implementation

# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the structure and approach for creating a comprehensive blog post series about Kiro's spec-driven development methodology, using the personal landing page project as a practical case study. The series will demonstrate how Kiro transforms AI-assisted development from ad-hoc "vibe coding" into a structured, repeatable, and durable process through specifications, design documents, and task planning.

The blog series serves as both educational content about spec-driven development philosophy and a practical guide showing the methodology in action. Each post will build upon the previous ones, creating a cohesive narrative that takes readers from understanding the theoretical foundations to seeing detailed implementation examples.

## Architecture

### Content Strategy

The blog series follows a progressive disclosure approach, starting with high-level concepts and gradually diving into specific implementation details. This mirrors the spec-driven development process itself: requirements → design → tasks → implementation.

### Series Structure

The blog series consists of 8 main categories of posts:

1. **Foundation Post** - Introduces spec-driven development philosophy
2. **Process Posts** - Cover requirements, design, and task planning phases
3. **Implementation Posts** - Detail each major task from the personal landing page project
4. **Reflection Post** - Synthesizes lessons learned and benefits observed

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Developers interested in AI-assisted development and structured methodologies
- **Secondary**: Engineering managers and technical leads evaluating development processes
- **Tertiary**: Students and junior developers learning software development best practices

## Components and Interfaces

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive blog post series about Kiro's spec-driven development philosophy and methodology, using the personal landing page project as a practical case study. The blog series will demonstrate how Kiro transforms software development through structured requirements, design, and implementation planning, with each task from the personal landing page project serving as a detailed example of the methodology in action.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Philosophical Foundation Blog Post

**User Story:** As a developer interested in AI-assisted development, I want to understand Kiro's spec-driven development philosophy, so that I can appreciate how it transforms "vibe coding" into structured, durable software development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the introductory blog post is created THEN the system SHALL explain how spec-driven development moves beyond prompt-by-prompt "vibe coding"
2. WHEN the philosophy is described THEN the system SHALL contrast specification-driven development with ad-hoc AI-assisted coding
3. WHEN Kiro's approach is explained THEN the system SHALL detail how specifications serve as "version controlled, human-readable super prompts"
4. WHEN benefits are outlined THEN the system SHALL emphasize the three key advantages: stakeholder alignment, AI agent guidance, and taming prompt chaos
5. WHEN the historical context is provided THEN the system SHALL reference the evolution from assembly language to higher-level abstractions and how AI enables the next leap
6. WHEN the post concludes THEN the system SHALL introduce the personal landing page case study as a practical demonstration of the methodology

### Requirement 2: Requirements Phase Blog Post

**User Story:** As a developer learning spec-driven development, I want to understand how requirements are gathered and structured, so that I can apply similar techniques in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the requirements blog post is created THEN the system SHALL explain the EARS format and user story methodology
2. WHEN the personal landing page requirements are discussed THEN the system SHALL show how rough ideas transform into structured requirements
3. WHEN the iterative process is described THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how requirements evolve through feedback
4. WHEN acceptance criteria are explained THEN the system SHALL show how they ensure completeness and testability
5. WHEN examples are provided THEN the system SHALL use actual requirements from the personal landing page project

### Requirement 3: Design Phase Blog Post

**User Story:** As a developer interested in systematic design, I want to understand how requirements translate into comprehensive design documents, so that I can create better architectural plans for my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design blog post is created THEN the system SHALL explain how requirements inform design decisions
2. WHEN the design process is described THEN the system SHALL show how research and context gathering work
3. WHEN architecture is discussed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate component and interface design
4. WHEN the personal landing page design is analyzed THEN the system SHALL highlight key design decisions and rationales
5. WHEN design validation is explained THEN the system SHALL show how designs address all requirements

### Requirement 4: Task Planning Blog Post

**User Story:** As a developer planning implementations, I want to understand how designs become actionable task lists, so that I can break down complex features into manageable coding steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the task planning blog post is created THEN the system SHALL explain how designs transform into implementation tasks
2. WHEN task structure is described THEN the system SHALL demonstrate hierarchical task organization
3. WHEN task details are explained THEN the system SHALL show how tasks reference requirements and build incrementally
4. WHEN the personal landing page tasks are analyzed THEN the system SHALL highlight task sequencing and dependencies
5. WHEN best practices are shared THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for effective task planning

### Requirement 5: Individual Task Implementation Blog Posts

**User Story:** As a developer following the spec-driven methodology, I want detailed explanations of how each task was implemented, so that I can understand the practical application of the methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual task blog posts are created THEN the system SHALL create one post per major task from the personal landing page project
2. WHEN each task is explained THEN the system SHALL describe the task objective, implementation approach, and key decisions
3. WHEN code examples are provided THEN the system SHALL show relevant code snippets and explain their purpose
4. WHEN challenges are discussed THEN the system SHALL highlight problems encountered and solutions applied
5. WHEN task completion is described THEN the system SHALL explain how the task fulfills its requirements

### Requirement 6: Methodology Benefits and Lessons Blog Post

**User Story:** As a developer considering spec-driven development, I want to understand the real-world benefits and lessons learned, so that I can evaluate whether to adopt this methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the benefits blog post is created THEN the system SHALL summarize key advantages observed during the personal landing page project
2. WHEN lessons learned are shared THEN the system SHALL provide honest insights about challenges and solutions
3. WHEN methodology comparison is made THEN the system SHALL contrast spec-driven development with ad-hoc development approaches
4. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL suggest when and how to apply spec-driven development
5. WHEN future directions are discussed THEN the system SHALL explore potential improvements and extensions to the methodology

### Requirement 7: Blog Post Structure and Quality

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want well-structured, engaging, and informative blog posts, so that I can easily understand and learn from the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blog posts are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent structure with introduction, main content, and conclusion
2. WHEN technical concepts are explained THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations accessible to developers of various skill levels
3. WHEN code examples are included THEN the system SHALL format them properly with syntax highlighting and explanations
4. WHEN posts are written THEN the system SHALL maintain an engaging, professional tone throughout
5. WHEN posts are completed THEN the system SHALL include proper frontmatter with metadata for the blog system

### Requirement 8: Series Cohesion and Navigation

**User Story:** As a reader following the blog series, I want clear connections between posts and easy navigation, so that I can follow the complete story of the spec-driven development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog series is created THEN the system SHALL ensure logical flow and progression between posts
2. WHEN posts reference each other THEN the system SHALL provide clear links and context
3. WHEN the series is introduced THEN the system SHALL provide an overview post that outlines the entire series
4. WHEN posts are tagged THEN the system SHALL use consistent tags for series identification and categorization
5. WHEN the series concludes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary post that ties together all learnings and insights

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The personal landing page website builds and deploys successfully to GitHub Pages, but encounters a critical JavaScript runtime error that prevents any content from displaying. The browser console shows "Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization" in the bundled JavaScript file, indicating a build-time issue with variable hoisting or module initialization order that needs to be resolved to make the site functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the site to load and display content without JavaScript errors, so that I can view the landing page and blog content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the deployed site THEN the page SHALL load without JavaScript errors in the browser console
2. WHEN the site loads THEN all content sections SHALL be visible and functional
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the routing SHALL work without runtime errors
4. IF there are build-time issues THEN the bundler SHALL generate valid JavaScript without variable initialization conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix the root cause of the JavaScript error, so that the build process produces working code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the build output THEN the source of the "Cannot access 'a' before initialization" error SHALL be identified
2. WHEN examining the bundled code THEN any variable hoisting or module loading issues SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN running the build process THEN the generated JavaScript SHALL be syntactically correct and executable
4. IF the error is related to MDX processing THEN the MDX compilation SHALL be fixed to generate proper JavaScript

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent similar JavaScript errors in the future, so that the build process remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the build process SHALL include proper error checking and validation
2. WHEN using dynamic imports or code splitting THEN the module loading order SHALL be correct
3. WHEN processing MDX files THEN the compilation SHALL generate valid JavaScript without initialization conflicts
4. IF there are TypeScript compilation issues THEN they SHALL be resolved to prevent runtime errors
